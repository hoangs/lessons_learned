A. _GIT_:
	1. Code management
	2. Open sourced
	3. Frankly intimidating but useful
B. _CSS_:
	1. 'Cascading Style Sheets'
	2. Can affect multiple pages on one site, a major time saver
C. _HTML_:
	1. Being familiar with it is one thing, but it's another to use 
it constantly on a near day to day basis
	2. I understand I need to be more consistent in using HTML in 
order to stay familiar with it
